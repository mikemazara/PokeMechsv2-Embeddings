## Note Basic Repair Hint A:

This section describes basic points that the service operator must understand before performing the service operation.

## 1. Appearance

- Always wear clean work clothing.

Wear a cap and protective shoes.

.

## 2.  Protection Of Vehicle Under Maintenance And Preparation Of Tools/ Equipment

- Before work, cover the vehicle body. (Ex. grille cover, fender cover, seat cover and floor mat cover)
Before performing the service operation, prepare tools, equipment, container box, grease and cloth etc.

.

![18_image_0.png](18_image_0.png)

## 3. Safety

- Before work, set the wheel stoppers to secure the vehicle.

- When performing work by multiple workers, call to each other to make sure that service operation is performed safely.

- Before starting engine, ventilate the room.

- When performing the service operation of high-temperature parts like muffler, rotating parts like fan and other movable parts, be careful not to get burned or injured.

- For the jack-up and lift up, set the tool to the proper location to support the vehicle correctly. And use the safety device properly when lifting up.

## 4.  Service Operation

- By identifying the vehicle problems thoroughly before work, service operation will be performed effectively. - Before removing parts, confirm the installation condition or the damage of the parts.

To reinstall parts properly, leave a note of the condition before work as necessary.

.

 For a part which needs positioning, take appropriate action such as putting alignment marks.

.

- For a removed part, clean it as necessary and check for damage and defect before installation.

## 5.  Removed Part

- A removed part must be organized to avoid mixing up with similar parts. When same parts are used in multiple locations, such as pistons in engine, manage the parts by using labels with cylinder No. so that the parts are not installed to the wrong location.

- Always replace nonreusable parts such as gasket and O-ring with new parts.

- After work, have a customer confirm the replaced part.

## 6.  When Removing Battery

When removing battery, power supply is cut off and the information stored in the computer memory is volatilized. Therefore, setting information of some device is initialized to the factory default. The device and functions initialized by removing battery are as follows. - Clock

- Set temperature of fully automatic air conditioner
- Automatic full open/close of driver's window
(power window needs to be initialized)
-  User setting items in the navigation system
- Past trouble history (memory code)

## B: Note

This is the information that can improve the efficiency of maintenance and assure the sound work.

## 1.  Fasteners Notice

Fasteners must be tightened to the specified torque.

Do not apply paint, lubricant, rust retardant or other substance to the surface around bolts, nuts, etc.

Doing so will make it difficult to obtain the correct torque and result in looseness and other problem.

## Caution: Do Not Spray Parts Cleaner Directly To Rubber Parts Such As Bushing Or Other Resin Parts. 2.  Static Electricity Damage

Do not touch the control modules, connectors, logic boards and other such parts when there is a risk of static electricity. Always use a static electricity prevention cord or touch grounded metal for the elimintion of static electricity before conducting work.

## 3. Battery

When removing the battery terminal, always be sure to turn the ignition switch to OFF and remove the battery ground cable first.

## 4.  Backup/Power Supply Fuse

Right after the vehicle has arrived, 10A backup fuse is removed to avoid run-down of the battery.

Connect the backup fuse as shown in the figure. Also, delivery mode is canceled by disconnecting the backup fuse from the fuse holder.

![19_image_0.png](19_image_0.png)

## 5.  Immobilizer Related Part

Do not replace parts which have immobilizer ID (all ignition key, combination meter, body integrated unit, ECM, and security control module for Canada)
with the parts from other vehicle.

## 6.  Service Parts

Use genuine parts for maximum performance and maintenance when conducting repairs. Subaru/FHI
will not be responsible for poor performance resulting from the use of parts except for genuine parts.

## 7.  Protecting Vehicle Under Main- Tenance

Make sure to attach the fender cover, seat covers, etc. before work.

## 8.  Ensuring Security During Work

When working in a group of two or more, perform the work with calling each other to ensure mutual safety.

## 9.  Lift And Jack

When using a lift or shop jack to raise a vehicle or using rigid rack to support a vehicle, always follow instructions concerning jack-up points and weight limits to prevent the vehicle from falling, which could result in injury. Be especially careful that the vehicle is balanced before raising it. Be sure to set the wheel stoppers when jacking-up only the front or rear side of the vehicle.

## Caution: Select The Lift Attachment So That The Side Sill Does Not Contact The Lift Arm. Note:

- When using a lift, follow its operation manual. - When the side sill cover contacts the lift arm, use a lift attachment. - Do not work or leave unattended while the vehicle is supported with jack, support it with rigid racks.

- Be sure to use the rigid racks with rubber attached to cradle to support the vehicle.

- When using a lift, use an attachment or something similar.

- When using a plate lift, use a rubber attachment.

Place the attachment to the specified position of the vehicle, by adjusting front/rear and left/right sides accordingly.

lf jacking up the front side of the vehicle, make sure that the jack is attached at the center of the jackup plate not at the sides.

## 10.Tie-Downs

Tie-downs are used when transporting vehicles and when using the chassis dynamo. Attach tie-down only to the specified locations on the vehicle.

- Tie-down location

![24_image_0.png](24_image_0.png)

(1)
Hook for tie-down
(2)
- Chain direction at tie-down condition CAUTION:
- Pull the front and rear of the vehicle in the opposite direction, and pull the left and right of the vehicle in the same direction.

- Patterns except for the followings (recommended) are not allowed.

![24_image_1.png](24_image_1.png)

## - Tie-Down Range

For ground transportation CAUTION: When the vehicle is tied down from vehicle inside, hook the hooks of tie-down chain on the rear tiedown hooks from vehicle inside. When the vehicle is tied down from vehicle outside, hook the hooks of tie-down chain on the rear tie-down hooks from vehicle outside.

![25_image_0.png](25_image_0.png)

![26_image_0.png](26_image_0.png)

## Caution:

- Basically, tie down using the tie-down hole.

 Tie-down procedure should be followed as much as reasonably possible depending on the deck
.

condition, however, lashing belt and vehicle must not contact each other. Also, if a wheel tie-down is conducted instead of using rear tie-down hole due to the vehicle loading condition of the deck, follow the instructions below.

1. Tie-down range must be within the backward of rear wheel as shown in the figure.

2. Wheel tie-down should be used only during sea transportation, and lashing belt should not contact air valve while tie-down. Be careful not damage the wheel and vehicle. 3. Maximum tie-down load to each lashing belt is 5000 N (510 kgf, 1124 lbf).

4. For steel wheel, do not tie down wheels.

- Vehicle sinking volume at tie-down condition

## Caution:

The vehicle sinking volume at tie-down condition should be less than 50 mm (1.97 in) and make sure to fix the vehicle securely.

Check to see if the tensions of chains or belts at tie-down condition are appropriate in the following procedures.

1) Before tie-down, measure the distance between the highest tire point and highest arch point at the center of wheel. 2) After tie-down, measure the distance between the highest tire point and highest arch point at the center of wheel.

3) If the distance (A) between the measured value of 1) and 2) above, is less than 50 mm (1.97 in), it is judged as OK. If the distance is 50 mm (1.97 in) or more, it is judged as NG because the tension is too high.

## - Notes For The Use Of Tie-Down Hook

When the vehicle is tied down from vehicle inside, hook the hooks of tie-down chain from vehicle inside, and when the vehicle is tied down from vehicle outside, hook the hooks of tie-down chain from vehicle outside.

For front tie-down hook, use S hook and J hook, and for rear tie-down hole, use S hook, J hook and T hook.

T hook can be used only for rear tie-down hole.

## 11.Towing

Avoid towing vehicles except when the vehicle cannot be driven. For models with AWD, AT or VTD, use a loader instead of towing. When towing other vehicles, pay attention to the following to prevent hook or vehicle damage resulting from excessive weight.

- Do not tow other vehicles with a front tie-down hook.

- Make sure the vehicle towing is heavier than the vehicle being towed.

- Front Remove the hook cover, and install the towing hook.

![28_image_0.png](28_image_0.png)

(B)
- Rear Remove the hook cover, and install the towing hook.

## Caution:

- Place the shift lever in "N" position during towing.

- Do not lift up the rear wheels to avoid unsteady rotation.

 Turn the ignition key to "ACC", then check the steering wheel moves freely. (Models without the keyless access with push button start system)
- Release the parking brake to avoid tire dragging.

-  Since the power steering does not work, be careful for the heavy steering effort. (When engine is stopped)
- Since the servo brake does not work, be careful that the brake is not applied effectively. (When engine is stopped)
- In case of the malfunction of internal transmission or drive system, lift up four wheels (on a trailer) for towing.

- Do not use towing hook (eye bolt) except when towing.

- Make sure to detach the towing hook (eye bolt) after towing. If it remains attached, airbag may not operate properly when receiving a shock. And it may also affect the crash performance of the vehicle.

## 12.Carrier Car

Before lowering the vehicle from the carrier car, perform the following operations. CAUTION: Always perform the following operations before lowering the vehicle from the carrier car. Otherwise, the power unit will rotate reversely, which may cause the damage to the engine, vacuum pump, and transmission.

1) Start the engine.

2) Set the transmission shift position into driving direction of the vehicle. (When the vehicle drives forward, do not set the transmission into R range. When the vehicle drives rearward, do not set the transmission into 1 - 6 speed, or D range.)
CAUTION: Be sure to perform 2) mentioned above even if the engine cannot be started in some reasons.

13.FRONT HOOD DAMPER STAY
1) Always perform works such as inspections and maintenance with both damper stays attached.

CAUTION: At the inspection and general maintenance, do not detach the damper stays.

![30_image_0.png](30_image_0.png)

NT-00366 2) When wider hood opening is necessary, set the damper stay below as shown in the figure.

## Tightening Torque: <Ref. To Eb-2, Front Hood, Component, General Description.>

CAUTION:
 Always perform works such as inspections and maintenance with both damper stays attached.

.

 Do not leave one side of damper stay removed.

.

The hood cannot be closed with the hood damper on the full open side. When it is necessary to
.

close, tie the hood striker and the radiator panel with a string etc. to fix them.

- After work, set the damper stays back to the normal position and tighten the bolts to the specified torque.

## 14.General Scan Tool

Using general scan tools will greatly improve the efficiency of repairing engine electronic throttle controls.

Subaru Select Monitor can be used to diagnose the engine, VDC, air conditioner and other parts.

## 15.Awd Circuit Measures

1) Full-time AWD MT model Since viscous coupling (limited slip differential) is used in the center differential, cut-off of AWD circuit cannot be carried out.

2) Full-time AWD 5AT model Since VTD type is used in the center differential, cut-off of AWD circuit cannot be carried out. 3) Full-time AWD CVT model Since electronically controlled MT-P hydraulic multi-plate clutch is adapted for center differential, switch to FWD by using Subaru Select Monitor.

## 16.Speedometer Test

1) Rear wheel free roller system
(1) Set the free roller on the floor of rear wheel side securely according to the wheel base and rear tread of the vehicle.

(2) Let the vehicle ride on the tester and free roller gently.

## Caution:

Fix the vehicle using a pulling metal (chain or wire) to the front and rear towing hooks or tiedown hook to prevent the lateral runout of front wheels and springing out of vehicle.

![32_image_0.png](32_image_0.png)

(3) Set the speedometer tester.

(4) Conduct the speedometer test work.

## Caution:

Do not operate the clutch quickly and do not accelerate or decelerate suddenly during work.

2) Rear wheel jack-up system
(1) Set the vehicle on speedometer tester.

## Caution:

Fix the vehicle using a pulling metal (chain or wire) to the front and rear towing hooks or tiedown hook to prevent the lateral runout of front wheels and springing out of vehicle.

(2) Jack up the rear wheels and set the rigid

racks to the specified locations of side sill.

| time of test       |                                      |

- When measurement is difficult to carry out because both of front wheels are locked, break force measurement in this condition conforms to standard grand total.

## 18.On The Car Wheel Balancing Caution:

- Carry out the procedures after measuring the balance of each single tire.

- Set the vehicle so that the front and rear wheels are the same height.

- Release the parking brake during measurement.

- Rotate each wheel by hands, and make sure it rotates without dragging.

- Do not operate the clutch quickly and do not accelerate or decelerate suddenly during work.

- When an error is indicated during engine drive, do not use the motor drive together.

1) Set the rigid rack to the specified locations of side sill, jack up the front or rear two wheels of nonmeasuring side and set the pickup stands to two wheels of measuring side.

![33_image_0.png](33_image_0.png)

2) For drive wheel, drive the tires with engine for measurement.

3) For non-drive wheel, drive the tires from the on the car wheel balancer for measurement.

| 1.     Recommended Materials |

1.

## Recommended Materials A:  Recommended Materials 1. General

To insure the best performance, always use the specified oil, gasoline, adhesive, sealant, etc. or a substitute of equivalent quality.

## 2. Fuel

- Use unleaded gasoline to reduce air pollution, because using leaded gasoline will damage the catalytic converter.

- Do not use the low quality gasoline, or improper fuel such as diesel fuel, fuel alcohol, or gasoline additive because they will adversely affect on engine components.

- Always use gasoline that is equivalent to that prescribed in the owner's manual or that of high octane value. There is the possibility of damaging or improper operation of the engine and fuel injection system if the specifications are not observed. Use the prescribed gasoline type to maintain proper vehicle performance.

## 3.  Lubricants

Use the lubricants shown in the table below, or equivalent. See the table below to choose the correct SAE
viscosity.

## Pre-Delivery Inspection 1. A:  General Description

The purposes of the pre-delivery inspection (PDI) are as follows.

- Remove the additional parts used for ensuring the vehicle quality during transportation and restore the vehicle to its normal condition.

- Check the vehicle before delivery is in normal condition. - Check the vehicle has no damage and no vehicle protective parts are missing while shipped or stored in a car barn. - Make sure to deliver a complete vehicle to customer.

For above reasons, all SOA service center must carry out the PDIs before delivery of vehicle. Besides, all SOA service center and PDI center check the condition of all vehicles to make sure to take responsibility.

Check that the power steering fluid level is normal.

If the amount is insufficient, check that no leaks are found. Then add the necessary amount of the specified power steering fluid.

![67_image_1.png](67_image_1.png)

Check entire areas of the vehicle for any trace of coolant/oil (such as engine and gear oil)/fluid (such as transmission and brake) leaks.

## 56.Water Leak Test

Spray the vehicle with water using a hose and check that no water enters the passenger compartment.

- Before performing the water leakage test, remove anything that may obstruct the operation or which must be kept dry.

- Close all the windows and doors securely. Close the hood and trunk lid before starting the test.

- Spray the vehicle with water using a hose. The rate of water spray must be approx. 20 to 25  l
(5.3 - 6.6 US gal, 4.4 - 5.5 Imp gal) per minute.

When spraying water on areas adjacent to the floor and wheel house, increase the pressure. When spraying water on areas other than the floor and wheel house, decrease the pressure. But the force of water must be made strong occasionally by pressing the end of the hose.

NOTE:
Be sure to keep the hose at least 10 cm (3.9 in)
away from vehicle.

Check the following areas.

- Front window and body framework mating portion
- Door mating portions

- Glass mating portions - Rear quarter window mating portions - Rear window and body framework mating por-
tion - Around roof drips If any dampness in the compartments is discovered after the water has been applied, carefully check all the areas that may have possibly contributed to the leak.

57.APPEARANCE CHECK 2 1) If protective coating (lap guard) is applied, remove it.

NOTE: - It is easier to remove the wrap guard using steam.

- For a vehicle left for a long time or at low temperature, sprinkle some water heated to 50 - 60°C
(122 - 140°F) over the vehicle to raise its surface temperature before peeling off the wrap guard. Do not use the water heated to over 60°C (140°F).

- If the adhesive remains exist on the coated surface, soak a flannel rag, etc. with a small amount of coating wax or solvent such as oil benzene and IPA, put the soaked cloth on the remains lightly, and then wipe them off with a flannel rag etc.

- Keep solvent from touching the resin or rubber parts. Do not use coating wax or solvent while the component surface temperature is high due to hot weather etc.

- If the coated surface is swollen out due to seams or moisture, expose the vehicle to the sunlight for a few hours or heat the seam and swollen portions using a dryer etc.

- Dispose of the peeled wrap guard as burnable industrial garbage. - If a yellow label is attached to the fog light lens, remove it. 2) Check the whole vehicle body for flaking paint, damage by transportation, corrosion, dirt, cracks or blisters. NOTE: - It is better to determine an inspection pattern in order to avoid missing an area, since the total inspection area is wide.

- Do not repair the body paint unless absolutely necessary. Also, if the vehicle is in need of repair to remove scratches or corroded paint, the repair area must be limited to the minimum. Re-painting and spray painting must be avoided as much as possible.

3) Check each window glass for scratches carefully. Slight damage may be removed by polishing with cerium oxide. (Fill a cup half with cerium oxide, and add warm water to it. Then agitate the content until it turns to wax. Apply this wax to a soft cloth, and polish the glass with it.)
4) Check each portion of the vehicle body and underside components for the formation of rust. If rust is discovered, remove it with sandpaper of \#80 to
\#180 and treat the surface with rust preventive. After this treatment is completed, flush the portion thoroughly, and prepare the surface for repair painting.

5) Check each portion of body and all of the exterior parts for deformation or distortion. Also, check each light lens for cracks.

6) Peel the protective tape, vinyl wrapping and identification seal attached to the following places.

- Seat
- Door trim
- Floor carpet - Side sill - Front hood lock release lever
- Edge rear
- Rear wiper - Sedan rear combination light (Trunk lid opening portion) - Roof rail - Assist rail - Door mirror (except for North America)

NOTE:
1. This inspection is not required to maintain emission warranty eligibility and it dose not affect the manufacturer's obligations under EPA's in-use compliance program.

2. When the vehicle is used in extremely dusty conditions, the air cleaner element should be replaced more often. 3. A tire should be replaced when the tread wear indicator appears as a solid band across the tread. The indicators appear when the remaining tread has been worn to 1.6 mm (0.063 in) or less.

4. When the vehicle is used under extremely dusty conditions, replace the A/C filter frequently.
